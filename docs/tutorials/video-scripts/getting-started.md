# Getting Started with IceType - Video Script

**Duration:** 7-8 minutes
**Target Audience:** Developers new to IceType, familiar with TypeScript
**Tone:** Friendly, informative, beginner-friendly

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction (0:00 - 1:00)

### Script

> Hey everyone! Welcome to this getting started tutorial for IceType.
>
> If you're tired of verbose schema definitions and want something that's concise, type-safe, and generates code for multiple backends, you're in the right place.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: IceType logo and tagline]**
>
> IceType is a schema language that lets you define your data models once and generate TypeScript types, database schemas, and even Apache Iceberg metadata from a single source of truth.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Diagram showing IceType schema -> TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Iceberg]**
>
> By the end of this video, you'll know how to:
> - Install IceType
> - Define your first schema
> - Generate TypeScript types
> - Create database migrations
> - Perform basic CRUD operations
>
> Let's dive in!

---

## Chapter 2: Installation (1:00 - 2:00)

### Script

> The fastest way to get started is with our create command.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Terminal window]**

```bash
npm create icetype@latest my-project
```

> **[DEMO: Run the command and show the interactive prompts]**
>
> This sets up a new project with IceType pre-configured. You'll get a sample schema file and all the dependencies you need.
>
> If you're adding IceType to an existing project, you can install it directly:

```bash
npm install icetype
```

> **[ON SCREEN: Show package.json with icetype dependency]**
>
> IceType works with Node.js 18 or later and supports both CommonJS and ES modules.
>
> For TypeScript projects, I recommend also installing `tsx` which lets you run TypeScript files directly:

```bash
npm install -D tsx
```

> Great! Now let's define our first schema.

---

## Chapter 3: First Schema Definition (2:00 - 4:00)

### Script

> Create a new file called `schema.ts` in your project root.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Open VS Code, create schema.ts]**

```typescript
import { parseSchema } from 'icetype';
```

> We start by importing `parseSchema` from IceType. This function takes your schema definition and parses it into a structured format.
>
> Let's create a simple User schema:

```typescript
export const UserSchema = parseSchema({
  $type: 'User',

  id: 'uuid!',
  email: 'string#',
  name: 'string',
  age: 'int?',
  isActive: 'bool = true',
  createdAt: 'timestamp',
});
```

> **[ON SCREEN: Highlight each line as you explain]**
>
> Let me break this down:
>
> - `$type: 'User'` - This is the entity name. Every schema needs one.
>
> - `id: 'uuid!'` - The exclamation mark means this field is required and unique. Perfect for primary keys.
>
> - `email: 'string#'` - The hash symbol means this field is indexed. Great for fields you'll query often.
>
> - `name: 'string'` - A regular string field. Required by default.
>
> - `age: 'int?'` - The question mark makes this field optional. Users don't have to provide their age.
>
> - `isActive: 'bool = true'` - You can set default values with the equals sign.
>
> - `createdAt: 'timestamp'` - Timestamps for tracking when records are created.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Show the modifier reference table]**
>
> Here's a quick reference:
> - `!` - Required and unique
> - `#` - Indexed
> - `?` - Optional
> - `[]` - Array type
>
> Now let's add a Post schema with a relation:

```typescript
export const PostSchema = parseSchema({
  $type: 'Post',
  $index: [['authorId'], ['publishedAt']],
  $fts: ['title', 'content'],

  id: 'uuid!',
  title: 'string!',
  content: 'text?',
  authorId: 'uuid!',
  author: '-> User!',
  publishedAt: 'timestamp?',
});
```

> **[ON SCREEN: Highlight the relation and directives]**
>
> Notice the arrow syntax `-> User!`. This creates a forward relation to the User entity. The arrow points to the related entity.
>
> We also added some directives:
> - `$index` creates secondary indexes on `authorId` and `publishedAt`
> - `$fts` marks `title` and `content` for full-text search

---

## Chapter 4: Type Generation (4:00 - 5:15)

### Script

> Now let's generate TypeScript types from our schema.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Terminal window]**

```bash
npx tsx node_modules/.bin/ice generate --schema ./schema.ts --output ./types.ts
```

> **[DEMO: Run the command]**
>
> Let's look at what was generated:
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Open types.ts]**

```typescript
/**
 * Generated by IceType
 */

export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  age?: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}

export interface Post {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content?: string;
  authorId: string;
  publishedAt?: Date;
}
```

> Beautiful! IceType converted our concise schema into fully typed TypeScript interfaces.
>
> Notice how:
> - `uuid!` became `id: string` (non-optional)
> - `int?` became `age?: number` (optional with the question mark)
> - `bool = true` became `isActive: boolean`
>
> You can import these types anywhere in your application and get full type safety.

---

## Chapter 5: Database Migration (5:15 - 6:30)

### Script

> IceType can also generate database schemas. Let's export to Iceberg format, which is great for data lake integration.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Terminal window]**

```bash
npx tsx node_modules/.bin/ice iceberg export \
  --schema ./schema.ts \
  --output ./metadata.json \
  --location s3://my-bucket/tables/users
```

> **[DEMO: Run the command and show output file]**
>
> This generates Iceberg v2 metadata that you can use with any Iceberg-compatible query engine.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Show metadata.json structure]**
>
> For SQL databases, you can use IceType's adapter packages. Here's an example with the Drizzle adapter:
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Code example]**

```typescript
import { transformToDrizzle } from '@icetype/drizzle';

const drizzleSchema = transformToDrizzle(UserSchema, {
  dialect: 'pg'
});
```

> IceType supports adapters for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, ClickHouse, DuckDB, and more. Check the documentation for the full list.

---

## Chapter 6: Basic CRUD Operations (6:30 - 7:30)

### Script

> Now let's see how you'd use these types in your application.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Code editor]**

```typescript
import { User, Post } from './types';

// Create a new user
const newUser: User = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  name: 'Alice',
  isActive: true,
  createdAt: new Date(),
};

// TypeScript will catch errors!
// newUser.age = 'thirty'; // Error: Type 'string' not assignable to 'number'
```

> **[ON SCREEN: Show TypeScript error highlighting]**
>
> Because we generated types from our schema, TypeScript catches type errors at compile time.
>
> Here's creating a post with a relation:

```typescript
const newPost: Post = {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  title: 'Hello IceType',
  content: 'This is my first post!',
  authorId: newUser.id,  // References the user
  publishedAt: new Date(),
};
```

> The `authorId` field links the post to its author. Your database schema enforces this relationship.
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Show the full workflow diagram]**
>
> That's the complete workflow:
> 1. Define schema in IceType
> 2. Generate types
> 3. Use types in your code
> 4. Export to your database format

---

## Chapter 7: Wrap Up (7:30 - 8:00)

### Script

> And that's IceType! You've learned how to:
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Checklist appearing]**
>
> - Install IceType with `npm create icetype`
> - Define schemas using the concise IceType syntax
> - Use field modifiers like `!`, `#`, `?`, and `[]`
> - Create relations between entities
> - Generate TypeScript types
> - Export to Iceberg and other database formats
>
> **[ON SCREEN: Links to documentation]**

> - The Schema Language Reference for all field types and modifiers
> - The CLI documentation for all available commands
> - The tutorials section for Drizzle integration and analytics workflows
